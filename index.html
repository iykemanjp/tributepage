        <ul>
          <li>
            Barack Hussein Obama II born <strong>August 4, 1961</strong> is an
            American politician and attorney who served as the 44th president of
            the United States from 2009 to 2017. A member of the Democratic
            Party, Obama was the first African-American president of the United
            States. He previously served as a U.S. senator from Illinois from
            2005 to 2008 and an Illinois state senator from 1997 to 2004.

            Obama was born in Honolulu, Hawaii. He attended Occidental College
            for two years before graduating from Columbia University in 1983,
            after which he worked as a community organizer in Chicago. In 1988,
            he enrolled in Harvard Law School, where he was the first black
            person to be president of the Harvard Law Review. After graduating,
            he became a civil rights attorney and an academic, teaching
            constitutional law at the University of Chicago Law School<strong>
              from 1992 to 2004.</strong

            he represented the 13th district from 1997 until 2004 in the
            Illinois Senate, when he ran for the U.S. Senate. Obama received
            national attention in 2004 with his March Senate primary win, his
            well-received July Democratic National Convention keynote address,
            and his landslide November election to the Senate. In 2008, he was
            nominated for president a year after his presidential campaign
            began, and after close primary campaigns against Hillary Clinton,
            Obama was elected over Republican John McCain and was inaugurated
            alongside Joe Biden on January 20, 2009. Nine months later, he was
            named the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize laureate.
